# MERN Heroku Example

This is a small template for building MERN applications that can be deployed directly to Heroku using git. 

The technology stack is basic MERN but without the database. Basically that means:
* Client is written in React
* Server is a node.js application using express.js

The application does very little on it's own, but the project demonstrates how you can structure a simple MERN application into a server and a client directory for automating deployment.
